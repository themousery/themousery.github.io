  <h2>Conway's Game of Life</h2>
  <p>Conway's Game of life, not to be confused with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Game_of_Life">board game</a>, is a cellular automaton designed by British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.</p>
  <p>The simulation is made up of cells which are either dead or alive. Every cell interacts with it's eight 'neighors', which are the cells that are vertically, horizontally, and diagonally adjacent. Each cell abides by the folling rules:</p>
  <l>
    <li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.</li>
    <li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.</li>
    <li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.</li>
    <li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</li>
  </l>
  <p>In this specific version, you can pause the simulation and click anywhere to birth or kill a cell. It should also be noted that some features of this particular rendition do not match other versions or the original.</p>
